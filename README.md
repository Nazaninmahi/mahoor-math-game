# 🌟 Mahoor's Math Game

This is an interactive math game I created for my daughter **Mahoor** to help her make learning basic math more fun and encouraging.

The game is built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, and opens in a colorful window where random math questions appear using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
