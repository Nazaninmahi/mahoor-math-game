# 🌟 Mahoor's Math Game

This is an interactive math game I created for my daughter **Mahoor** to help her make learning basic math more fun and encouraging.

The game is built using **Python** and **Tkinter**, and opens in a colorful window where random math questions appear using addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Random math problems using numbers from **0 to 20**
- Some problems include **letter variables** from my daughter Mahoor's name:
  - `m = 5`
  - `a = 2`
  - `h = 6`
  - `o = 9`
  - `r = 3`
- Fun and positive feedback after each answer
- A **star (⭐)** is earned for every 5 correct answers
- After collecting **15 stars**, a celebration screen with stars and sound appears 🎉

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI window)
- *(Future updates may include sound using playsound or pygame)*

## 🔧 How to Run


## 🧡 Inspiration

I designed this game with love for my daughter Mahoor.  
Her name is part of the game itself, used as variables in the math equations — making every question feel personal and meaningful.  
This is a small project that combines learning, joy, and love all in one.
